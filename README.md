# Geofence-Homomorphic-Encryption
Crypto-geofence
Is it possible for us to check if I'm inside a geofence, without revealing my location to the server, and without the server giving me the true geofence?

## What is homomorphic encryption?
It is a new technique where you can perform arithmetic operations on encrypted numbers.  It's possible with a few different algorithms, including the factoring-based one
used here (Paillier).  In the future it might be better to use a quantum-resistent algorithm based on lattice cryptography.
